## ðŸ‘‹ Hello

The must-have resource for anyone who wants to experiment with and build on the [OpenAI API] (https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides). 
This repository serves as a hub for innovative experiments, showcasing an AI-driven tool designed to simplify cancer education, making it accessible and supportive for all users. 
Utilized a fine-tuned LLM from OpenAI to address cancer-related inquiries with accuracy and empathy. Built with a user-friendly UI/UX using Streamlit, the project highlights the potential of targeted AI applications in making complex health information widely accessible. Aims to enhance cancer awareness, encourage informed health decisions, and support early prevention efforts.
